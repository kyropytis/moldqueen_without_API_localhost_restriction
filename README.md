## Download — install the app

**📲 [Latest signed release](https://github.com/jrichter24/moldqueen/releases/latest)** — the standalone **Android app**, signed by the author.

1. Download **`moldqueen-v0.1.2.apk`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/jrichter24/moldqueen/releases/latest).
2. On your phone, allow **install from unknown sources** for your browser or file manager (Android prompts the first time).
3. Open the APK to install, then launch **MoldQueen → Connect → Ready → drive**.

It's one self-contained app — it owns the radio *and* serves the UI on-device, so no Pi or network is needed.
Prefer to build it yourself? `cd android-core && ./gradlew installDebug` (over USB).

**DOWNLOAD FROM RELEASE PAGE, NOT FDROID**


The **Raspberry Pi** path is in [Quickstart](#quickstart) below.

## The idea: API-first — thin transport, smart client

moldqueen is built around **one documented WebSocket contract** and an unusual split:

- **The radio core is a _thin transport_.** It takes a raw `set {slot, channel, value}`,
  turns it into a Mould King BLE "telegram," crypts it, and broadcasts it. It knows
  **nothing** about functions, channel maps, inversion, caps, or your specific toy.
- **A single web client is the _smart_ half.** It resolves *function → (slot, channel,
  value)*, owns the per-layout channel map, and runs the keepalive + STOP safety latch.

Because all the smarts live above the contract, **the radio core is swappable**: a
**Raspberry Pi** (raw HCI/BlueZ), a **standalone Android app** (native BLE), and an
**ESP32-S3** (ESP-IDF + NimBLE, over WiFi) each expose the *identical* WebSocket API and
serve the *same* client — so the UI is written once and the hardware is pluggable
(*swap the radio core, keep the client*). (The hubs are driven by *broadcasting* crafted BLE adverts, not over
GATT.) The **Mould King 13112 excavator** is the hardware-proven reference; the
layout system + auto-assign let you drive **any** Mould King toy on these hubs.

## Quickstart

### Raspberry Pi (primary path)

Pi with a USB BLE dongle, Python 3.13, a solid 5 V/3 A PSU:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrichter24/moldqueen && cd moldqueen
scripts/start.sh        # frees the adapter from bluetoothd, brings the dongle up by MAC, runs both processes
# → open http://<pi>:8080/  →  Connect  →  button one hub to slot 1  →  Ready  →  drive
```

With `avahi-utils` installed the Pi is discoverable by name as **`moldqueenrasp.local`**
(`ws://moldqueenrasp.local:8765`), mirroring the ESP32's `moldqueenesp.local` — additive, the IP
still works. Full prep (disable onboard BT, mask `bluetoothd`, caps), mDNS, and a dry-run mode:
**[`dev-docs/QUICKSTART.md`](dev-docs/QUICKSTART.md)**.

</p>

---

### ESP32-S3 (the third radio core)

A tiny ESP-IDF + NimBLE board that drives real toys
over WiFi today, exposing the same WebSocket contract as the Pi and Android cores. It's a
usable standalone appliance: no credentials are baked in, so on first boot it opens a setup
WiFi (`moldqueen-setup`) for you to enter your network; after that it's discoverable as
`moldqueenesp.local` and carries a built-in management page at `moldqueenesp.local:8080`
(status, restart, switch-to-setup, change-network). Point the client at
`ws://moldqueenesp.local:8765` and drive.

**🔌 Download the firmware:** grab `moldqueen-esp32-<tag>.bin` from the
**[latest release](https://github.com/jrichter24/moldqueen/releases/latest)** (current:
`esp-v0.1.0`) and flash the single image at offset `0x0`:

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 write_flash 0x0 moldqueen-esp32-<tag>.bin
```

Step-by-step setup walkthrough: **[`dev-docs/ESP32_SETUP.md`](dev-docs/ESP32_SETUP.md)**.

  <img src="docs/assets/esp32_with_code_example.png" alt="An ESP32-S3 running the moldqueen radio core, driving a Mould King hub over WiFi" width="600">
</p>

---

### Android (standalone, no Pi)

Own native radio + bundled client in one APK:

```bash
cd android-core && ./gradlew installDebug    # build + install to a connected device
# → open the MoldQueen app  →  Connect  →  Ready  →  drive
```

Build/device detail: **[`dev-docs/ANDROID.md`](dev-docs/ANDROID.md)**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/android_bricks_on_phone_preview.png" alt="MoldQueen running standalone on an Android phone" width="600">
</p>

---

### Run the client with Docker (no Python)

A published, public client-only image serves the web UI with one command, no Python, no
build. It hosts the client over `http://localhost`, so it can connect to a plain `ws://`
device on your LAN (same protocol, no mixed-content block). It's a real local-hosting
option for driving **your own** device, not a hosted demo:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/jrichter24/moldqueen-client:latest
# → open http://localhost:8080/  →  point the WS endpoint at your device
#   (ws://moldqueenrasp.local:8765 / ws://moldqueenesp.local:8765 / ws://<ip>:8765)
```

The host port is the **left** number, so remap freely (e.g. `-p 9090:8080`). Use
**`:latest`** for the newest build or pin **`:0.1.0`** for the current version. Image on
the [GitHub Packages page](https://github.com/jrichter24/moldqueen/pkgs/container/moldqueen-client);
depth in **[`dev-docs/REMOTE_CLIENT.md`](dev-docs/REMOTE_CLIENT.md)**.

> **Just exploring?** Run the client alone against a Pi —
> **[`dev-docs/DEV_CLIENT.md`](dev-docs/DEV_CLIENT.md)** (dev server) or
> **[`dev-docs/REMOTE_CLIENT.md`](dev-docs/REMOTE_CLIENT.md)** (Docker).

## What it does

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/start_page_preview.png" alt="The moldqueen start-page chooser — layout cards with Generic/Model and MK4/MK6 badges" width="760">
</p>

- **Layouts** — pick one from the start-page chooser:
  - **Excavator** (model-specific): landscape HMI dashboard, drag-joysticks + hold buttons.
  - **12-axis** and **Brick / PS-like** (model-agnostic): generic gamepads with **12 motors**
    you map to any toy.
  - **RAW** (debug): a protocol bench over the raw `set`/`stop` path (slot/channel/value,
    telegram + on-air bytes console).
- **Chooser / start page** — cards with a **Generic / Model** badge and **MK4 / MK6**
  protocol badges (both **MK4** and **MK6** are live; MK6 ships on the Pi + web client), a **jump-to-layout** dropdown, and the RAW
  bench behind a debug icon.
- **One shared chrome (MK4Chrome)** — every layout gets the same menu, settings, connect
  wizard, status light, language picker, keyboard STOP, and gamepad path.
- **Profile-driven auto-assign** — map a generic controller's 12 motors to channels by
  toy *profile* (vehicle / car / custom) with an inline editor and a zero-box guide.
- **Gamepad** — pair a DualSense (or any) controller over Bluetooth and drive, on the
  excavator **and** the generic layouts — in the browser or the Android app; touch always
  works too. *(detail: [`dev-docs/GAMEPAD.md`](dev-docs/GAMEPAD.md))*

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/controller_example.png" alt="PlayStation and Xbox controllers — gamepad support" width="600">
</p>

- **6 languages** (EN/DE complete; ZH/KO/ES/FR seeded, EN fallback), editable per-layout
  title + colour.
- **Safety** — affirmative keepalive (the client re-affirms intent ~10/s; the server
  auto-neutralizes any un-refreshed channel) + STOP = kill-and-reconnect-at-neutral.

## Connection wizard

Cold-starting these hubs is fiddly, so the **shared client chrome (MK4Chrome)** has a
guided **connection wizard**: it walks you from *power on* to *Ready*, and it shows the
hub's real **LED-flash patterns** so you can confirm you're talking to the right hub and
assigning the right slot (one long flash = powered on; fast flashing = connecting; button
a hub to one/two/three fast flashes to put it on slot 0/1/2). It's a **client feature, so
you get it on every layout and against every radio core** (Raspberry Pi or the standalone
Android app), not something Pi- or Android-specific.

<!-- The actual hub LED flash patterns the wizard teaches. Placeholder for richer
     real-device GIFs later (driving footage); for now these convey real hardware. -->

## Architecture

Thin transport (server) + smart client (UI), with a swappable radio core behind one
WebSocket contract:

```
client/        # the INDEPENDENT smart web client (chooser · layouts · MK4Chrome · channel maps)
   │  ws://…:8765  (the contract: setup · set · stop · state · info)
   ├── linux-core/   # Pi radio core — raw HCI/BlueZ; serves the client (Python)
   ├── android-core/ # standalone Android radio core — native BLE; serves the client (Kotlin)
   └── esp32-core/   # ESP32-S3 radio core — ESP-IDF + NimBLE over WiFi (C)
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/many_machienes_example.png" alt="The same UI on a Raspberry Pi, an Android phone, a laptop and an ESP32 — one WebSocket contract" width="720">
</p>

The client resolves *function → channel* and sends only low-level `set`; the core makes a
nibble, crypts it (`MouldKingCrypt`), and broadcasts the BLE telegram. One MK4 telegram
drives all hubs at once (12 nibbles = 3 slots × 4 channels). The **Raspberry Pi + web
client** also speak **MK6** (a byte-per-channel, per-device-addressed telegram) and can
drive an MK4 box and an MK6 box **at the same time**, which the official Mould King app
can't do ([how mixed mode works](dev-docs/MIXED_MODE.md)); the ESP32 and Android cores are
MK4-only for now. Deep dive: protocol, crypto, the dual-radio finding, the WS contract:
**[`dev-docs/PROJECT.md`](dev-docs/PROJECT.md)** (the source of truth) and the
machine-readable **[`asyncapi.yaml`](linux-core/mk4web/asyncapi.yaml)**.

## Roadmap

The **ESP32-S3 radio core** is now a working third sibling, a usable standalone appliance.
It drives real toys over WiFi today (clean-room C `MouldKingCrypt` port, NimBLE `0xFFF0`
advertiser, 300 ms auto-neutral safety, WiFi WebSocket server mirroring the Pi's `api.py`),
plus **WiFi provisioning** (no creds baked in: a fallback `moldqueen-setup` AP + a branded
bilingual setup page), **mDNS discovery** as `moldqueenesp.local`, a **management page**
at `moldqueenesp.local:8080` (status, restart, switch-to-setup, change-network), Pi mDNS
(`moldqueenrasp.local` for linux-core), and a binary/release pipeline (a downloadable `.bin`,
published per `esp-v*` tag). The ESP32 core is **complete** and stays a thin-transport radio
core that a hosted client drives; **serving the client from the board's own flash was decided
against** (the several-MB client vs limited flash, and the page-load asset burst coexisting with
BLE on the shared 2.4 GHz radio). What's still ahead:

- **MK6 on the ESP32 & Android cores.** MK6 (and simultaneous mixed MK4+MK6) already ships on the Pi + web client; the remaining work is the MK6 telegram path on the ESP32 and Android radios.
- **Camera, ToF sensor** — telemetry over/alongside the API.
- **AI brain / console client** — an agent driving the toy through the same WebSocket API.

Detail + status: **[`dev-docs/ROADMAP.md`](dev-docs/ROADMAP.md)**.

## Contributing

Issues, PRs, and especially new toy layouts are welcome. See
**[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for how to contribute and the conventions to
respect (thin transport / smart client, one client / no forks, the safety model). It
also explains why this repo **keeps its AI-assisted-workflow files (`CLAUDE.md` + the
`.claude/agents/`) in version control on purpose** — for transparency about how the
project is built, and as a working example you can copy for your own setup.
